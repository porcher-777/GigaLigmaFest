Petit message de RDR

Hi. I’m RDR,

Since I loved listening to music and drawing, I started making animated music videos. I wanted to share my art with many people, so I started posting my work on YouTube, 
and now more than 530,000 people subscribed to watch my stories.
I hope my class will help those who want to tell their stories to many people. I’m an artist that creates animation. I make animated music videos with a 
retro atmosphere. As I continued to work on animation, I got a lot of support from many people, especially for my music video “Day of the Month” with 1.6 million views on YouTube.
In order to experience everything from character design to animation production and editing, I would like to take the time to show you my creation process through my newest animation,
 “FEEL GOOD”.
